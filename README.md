this is a program that generates and prints 3 random integers from 1 - 9. It then asks the user for 3 intergers. It then tells you if you have a ball or strike. A ball means that 1 of your inputted numbers is 1 of the 3 random generated numbers but not in the correct spot. A strikes means that 1 of your inputted numbers is 1 of the 3 random generated numbers in the correct spot. If you guess correctly all 3 integers and their position it will then ask if you want to play again or quit the program.
